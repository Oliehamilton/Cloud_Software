# Data_Visualisation_Cloud_Software

In this project, I worked as a Data Analyst at an IT company that provides cloud-based solutions to businesses. My primary tasks involved predicting software demand, classifying system issues by severity, detecting anomalies, and developing a recommendation system. The goal was to enhance the company’s ability to anticipate customer needs, optimize response strategies, and improve service delivery.

Key Responsibilities:
1.	Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
  - Conducted a thorough exploratory data analysis on a time series dataset to identify trends, seasonality, and inconsistencies.
  - Cleaned and prepared the dataset for further analysis, ensuring data quality for accurate forecasting and modeling.
2.	Time Series Forecasting for Software Demand:
  - Developed a time series model to forecast monthly demand for the company’s top software products over the next year.
  - Evaluated the model's performance, focusing on accuracy and its ability to account for seasonal variations in demand.
3.	Classification and Anomaly Detection:
  - Built a classification model to categorize incoming system issues into 'Urgent', 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low' severity levels, based on various factors like issue type and customer impact.
  - Implemented an anomaly detection algorithm to identify unusual patterns in system logs, which could indicate potential security threats or system failures.
4.	Recommendation System:
  - Developed a recommendation system for an online retail store client, identifying the most commonly sold items.
  - Provided personalized recommendations for three random customers, leveraging the system’s ability to suggest products based on purchasing patterns.
